// SolarSystem.DB 
export const solarSystemIntro = `My first project at CodeClan! We were given a week to complete a solo project to consolidate and expand on what we had learned in the first weeks of the course.`
export const solarSystemOverview = `**SolarSystem.DB** is a dynamic full stack web application designed to visualise and manage information related to the Solar System. Developed using a user-centric approach, this project aimed to offer immersive experience for the user in exploring celestial objects stored within a PostgreSQL database. Offering full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, users can easily add, edit, or remove solar entities. Additionally the app provides a personalised experience utilising a login system and allowing users to keep track of their interactions through a ‘system report’ feature. This project reflects my journey in learning object-oriented programming with Python. I ensured adherence to RESTful route conventions, further demonstrated by the nested routes dedicated to moons, reflecting their unique relationship with their respective planets. Notably, SolarSystem.DB was built without relying on JavaScript or front-end frameworks, in alignment with strict project guidelines.`;
export const solarSystemFeatures = `

- **Dynamic Visualisation:** Immersive and interactive interface, dynamically rendering information and high quality images of Solar Objects.

- **Full CRUD Functionality:** Users can manipulate the Solar System's catalogue by adding, updating, or removing solar entities.

- **Simple Login System:** A user-friendly login page allows users to track their exploration journey and view comprehensive 'system reports.'

- **RESTful Route Convention:** Implemented RESTful routing and a nested route structure for moons.

- **Data Integrity:** Leverage PostgreSQL to ensure data integrity, and engage in efficient database interactions using Psycopg and Python.`;


export const solarSystemTechnologies = `

- **Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Employed Python's versatile capabilities and practiced OOP principles to create a robust and maintainable codebase.

- **HTML and CSS:** Crafted engaging and visually appealing frontend pages using HTML and CSS, adhering to strict project guidelines that prohibited external libraries like Bootstrap.`;

// PhoenixTrader 
export const phoenixTraderIntro = `My second project whilst studying professional software development at CodeClan. This was a group project tasked with creating a full stack app using JavaScript, Express, React and a public API.`;
export const phoenixTraderOverview = `**PhoenixTrader** is a user-friendly investment portfolio management tool. The project aimed to allows users to track and analyse their investments while staying connected to real-time market data. It allows for the maintenance of a detailed portfolio, easy access to order history, and the creation of personalised watchlists. The application provides comprehensive performance insights, dynamic visualisation through charts, and tailored news stories to keep users informed. Built using MongoDB, Express.js, React JS, FinnHub API, Node.js, and tested with Jest and React testing library.`;

// Gwentish! 
export const gwentishIntro = `For my final and capstone project at CodeClan, we were asked to spend a more prolonged time on a project of our choice using the languages and technologies taught in the course.`
export const gwentishOverview = 'Gwentish! Is a full stack application that aims to recreate Gwent, the famous mini game from the acclaimed Witcher franchise. The aim of the project was to recreate the base features of the game and at its core, Gwentish! offers players the chance to create personalised decks, strategise their moves, and engage in turn-based duels using real Gwent card data. A notable highlight of this project lies in its architectural composition, where two distinct applications merge their functionalities. The backend, powered by Java, serves as the backbone, handling critical game logic and maintaining the game state. Concurrently, the frontend, built with React JS, takes on the role of orchestrating user interactions, overseeing the flow of the game, and rendering the game board and cards.';
export const gwentishFeatures = `
- **Player Login:** Gwentish! Allows players to create accounts, log in, and keep track of their gaming journey. This feature ensures a personalised gaming experience and allows players to built personalised decks.

- **Personalised Decks:** Players have the freedom to assemble their decks from a vast selection of real Gwent cards, each with its own unique abilities and strengths. This customisation aspect adds depth and strategy to the gameplay.

- **Visualised Game Board:** The game recreates the interactive game board that immerses players in the Gwent universe.

- **Strategic Card Play:** Gwentish! emphasises tactical thinking and decision-making, with players strategically placing their cards on the board to outwit opponents. 

- **Live Score Updates and Game Messaging:** Real-time score updates keep players informed about their progress during the match.
