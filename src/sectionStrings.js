// SolarSystem.DB 
export const solarSystemOverview = `**SolarSystem.DB** is a dynamic web application designed to visualise and manage information related to the Solar System. Developed with a user-centric approach, this project offers an immersive experience in exploring celestial objects stored within a PostgreSQL database. Offering full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, users can seamlessly add, edit, or remove solar entities. One of the standout features of SolarSystem.DB is its login system, empowering users to keep track of their interactions and journey. The 'system report' feature provides insights into user visits and interactions with the Solar System's components. This project showcases my proficiency in object-oriented programming with Python, as well as my mastery of Test Driven Development (TDD) principles. I ensured adherence to RESTful route conventions, further demonstrated by the cleverly nested routes dedicated to moons, reflecting their unique relationship with their respective planets. Notably, SolarSystem.DB was crafted without relying on JavaScript or front-end frameworks, in alignment with strict project guidelines.`;
